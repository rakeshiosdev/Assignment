# TechAssignment app with Clean Architecture and SwiftUI


ðŸ“– Overview  

This project is developed in SwiftUI using Clean Architecture principles. It demonstrates separation of concerns across layers (Domain, Data, Presentation), following MVVM design pattern and async/await for modern concurrency.

The app fetches and displays a list of users from a JSON API. It includes:

* DTOs and domain models

* Mappers for data transformation

* Use cases to encapsulate business logic

* Dependency Injection and Dependency Inversion for testability

* Unit tests for ViewModel, UseCase, and Repository layers    

ðŸ”¹ Features  

* **Clean Architecture:** Separation between Domain, Data, and Presentation.

* **MVVM Pattern:** ViewModel handles business logic, View handles UI rendering.

* **Modern Concurrency:** Uses async/await for networking.

* **Network Layer:** Generic NetworkManager for making API calls.

* **DTO & Mapper:** Converts API JSON to domain entities.
  
* **Unit Testing:** Tests for business logic and data transformations.


ðŸ›  Technologies Used
  
* **Language:** Swift 5+

* **UI Framework:** SwiftUI

* **Architecture:** Clean Architecture + MVVM

* **Networking:** URLSession + async/await

* **Testing:** XCTest
